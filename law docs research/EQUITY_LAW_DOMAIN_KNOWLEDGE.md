## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive domain knowledge for **Equity Law**, a fundamental area of Australian law derived from historical English Chancery courts. Equity operates alongside common law and statute to provide remedies and enforce duties that cannot be adequately addressed through common law alone. Key areas include trusts, fiduciary duties, estoppel, unconscionable conduct, undue influence, and equitable remedies.

**Domain Characteristics:**
- **Primary Source:** Common law (judicial precedent)
- **Secondary Source:** State/Territory Trustee Acts and specific equity legislation
- **Distinguishing Feature:** Discretionary remedies based on principles of conscience and fairness
- **Core Maxims:** "Equity follows the law," "He who comes to equity must come with clean hands," "Equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy"

## 2. KEY DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS

### 2.1 What is Equity?

**Definition:**
```
Equity is a body of legal principles that supplement the common law and statute,
providing remedies and enforcing obligations based on conscience, fairness,
and natural justice.

Historical Origin:
- Developed in English Court of Chancery (pre-1875)
- Addressed rigidity and gaps in common law
- Merged with common law in Judicature Acts (1873-1875)
- Now administered in same courts but as distinct principles
```

**Relationship to Common Law:**
- Equity supplements but does not replace common law
- Where conflict exists, equity prevails: "Equity prevails over law"
- Courts apply both equitable and common law principles

---

### 2.2 Core Equitable Concepts

#### **Trust**
```
Definition: A relationship where one person (trustee) holds property for
the benefit of another (beneficiary), with the trustee owing fiduciary
obligations to manage that property.

Essential Elements:
1. Certainty of intention (intention to create trust)
2. Certainty of subject matter (identifiable trust property)
3. Certainty of objects (identifiable beneficiaries or charitable purpose)

Types:
- Express trusts (intentionally created)
- Resulting trusts (implied from circumstances)
- Constructive trusts (imposed by law to prevent unjust enrichment)
```

**Express Trust:**
```
Created by settlor's explicit intention, usually:
- Inter vivos (during lifetime): Declaration or transfer to trustee
- Testamentary (in will): Takes effect on death

Requirements:
- Three certainties must be satisfied
- Compliance with formalities (writing for land under statute)
- Lawful purpose

Common Examples:
- Family trusts (discretionary trusts)
- Unit trusts
- Testamentary trusts
- Charitable trusts
- Superannuation trusts
```

**Resulting Trust:**
```
Arises by operation of law where:
1. Express trust fails (e.g., lack of certainty)
2. Automatic resulting trust: Property reverts to settlor
3. Purchase money resulting trust: A provides funds, B takes title
4. Presumed resulting trust: Property transferred without consideration

Modern Application:
- Voluntary conveyance (transfer without payment)
- Contribution to purchase price
- Quistclose trust (loan for specific purpose)
```

**Constructive Trust:**
```
Imposed by law to prevent unconscionable conduct or unjust enrichment.

Not dependent on intention; arises from:
- Breach of fiduciary duty
- Knowing receipt of trust property
- Knowing assistance in breach of trust
- Unconscionable retention of property
- Mutual wills
- Secret trusts (arising from testamentary promises)

Purpose:
- Remedy for wrongdoing
- Restitution of unjust enrichment
- Enforcement of equitable obligations
```

#### **Fiduciary**
```
Definition: A person who stands in a relationship of trust and confidence
with another, owing duties of loyalty, good faith, and to act in the
best interests of the other person.

Core Characteristics:
- Undertakes to act in another's interests
- Exercises discretion or power affecting another's interests

- Relationship of ascendancy and influence

Established Fiduciary Relationships:
- Trustee-beneficiary
- Director-company
- Partner-partnership

```
Definition: Person entitled to benefit from trust property or for whom
fiduciary acts.

Rights:
- Right to due administration of trust
- Right to compel performance of trustee duties

Types:
- Life tenant (entitled to income during lifetime)
- Remainderman (entitled to capital after life tenancy)
- Discretionary beneficiary (potential beneficiary, no fixed entitlement)
- Cestui que trust (archaic term for beneficiary)
```

#### **Settlor**
```
Definition: Person who creates a trust by transferring property to trustees
or declaring themselves trustee.

Also known as:

## 4. MAXIMS OF EQUITY

Equitable maxims are principles guiding equitable jurisdiction and remedies.

### 4.1 Core Maxims

**1. Equity follows the law**
```
Equity supplements common law but does not contradict it. Where common law
provides remedy, equity generally defers.
```

**2. He who comes to equity must come with clean hands**
```
Plaintiff seeking equitable relief must not have engaged in misconduct
related to subject matter of claim.

Examples:
- Plaintiff who breached contract cannot seek specific performance
- Plaintiff who acted unconscionably cannot invoke equity
```

**3. Equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy**
```
Equity intervenes where common law provides no adequate remedy.

Foundation for:
- Creation of new equitable remedies
- Extension of equity to novel situations
- Constructive trusts to remedy unjust enrichment
```

**4. Equity regards as done that which ought to be done**
```
Where party has obligation to do something, equity treats it as done.

Applications:
- Doctrine of conversion (contract for sale of land converts to personalty)
- Specifically enforceable contracts treated as completed
```

**5. Equity is equality**
```
Where no other basis exists, equity divides equally.

Applications:
- Co-ownership presumed equal (tenancy in common)
- Distribution among beneficiaries
```

**6. Equity looks to intent rather than form**
```
Substance over form; equity examines true intention and effect.

Applications:
- Trust creation: substance of arrangement controls
- Shams and pretenses disregarded
```

**7. Equity imputes an intention to fulfill an obligation**
```
Where person does act that could satisfy obligation, equity presumes
intention to fulfill obligation.

Applications:
- Satisfaction of debts
- Performance of legacies
- Ademption
```

**8. Equity acts in personam**
```
Equity operates on conscience of defendant personally, not directly on
property (historically).

Effect:
- Equitable orders are personal commands
- Contempt sanctions for breach
- Extraterritorial effect possible
```

**9. Delay defeats equity (Laches)**
```
Unreasonable delay in asserting rights may bar equitable relief.

Laches Doctrine:
- Unreasonable delay
- Acquiescence or knowledge
- Prejudice to defendant or change of circumstances
- Inequitable to grant relief

Distinguished from Limitation Acts:
- Equitable defense, not statutory bar
- More flexible, context-specific
```

**10. Equity aids the vigilant, not those who slumber**
```
Related to laches; equity rewards prompt assertion of rights.
```

**11. Where equities are equal, the law prevails**
```
Where competing equitable claims are equal, legal title prevails.
```

**12. Where equities are equal, the first in time prevails**
```
Where competing equitable interests, earlier in time takes priority.
```

## 5. DISTINCTION FROM CONTRACT AND TORTS

### 5.1 Equity vs. Contract Law

**Contract Law:**
- Consensual obligations based on agreement
- Common law remedies: damages (expectation, reliance, restitution)
- Rights and duties defined by contract terms
- Privity doctrine (only parties bound)

**Equity Overlay:**
- **Equitable remedies for breach:** Specific performance, injunction
- **Equitable defenses:** Unconscionability, undue influence, misrepresentation
- **Rescission:** Equitable remedy to void contract
- **Rectification:** Correct written instrument
- **Promissory estoppel:** Enforce promises without consideration

**Key Differences:**
- **Remedies:** Equity provides remedies where damages inadequate
- **Formation:** Equity may enforce promises lacking contractual consideration (estoppel)
- **Defenses:** Equity provides additional grounds to set aside contracts
- **Discretion:** Equitable remedies discretionary; contractual damages generally as of right

---

### 5.2 Equity vs. Tort Law

**Tort Law:**
- Civil wrongs causing harm to person or property
- Common law remedies: damages (compensatory, punitive in limited cases)
- Duty of care, causation, remoteness
- Fault-based or strict liability

**Equity Overlay:**
- **Breach of confidence:** Equitable wrong (not tort)
- **Breach of fiduciary duty:** Equitable wrong (not tort)
- **Equitable compensation:** Different measure than tortious damages
- **Account of profits:** Gain-based remedy (not compensatory)
- **Injunctions:** Equitable remedy to prevent or restrain tortious conduct

**Key Differences:**
- **Nature of Duty:** Fiduciary duty based on relationship of trust; tortious duty based on law
- **Remedies:** Equity focuses on proprietary remedies, restitution, disgorgement; tort focuses on compensation
- **Causation:** Equitable compensation uses "but for" test; tort uses remoteness and foreseeability
- **Priority:** Equitable proprietary claims rank ahead of unsecured creditors; tort claims do not

## 8. SPECIAL FEATURES OF EQUITY

### 8.1 Discretionary Nature of Remedies

**Characteristic:**
- Equitable remedies are discretionary, not as of right
- Court considers all circumstances, including plaintiff's conduct
- Defenses: laches, acquiescence, clean hands, hardship

**Contrast with Common Law:**
- Damages at common law generally as of right if breach proved
- Equitable relief requires equity's favor

---

### 8.2 Relationship with Statute

**Equity and Statute:**
- Statute can codify, modify, or abolish equitable principles
- Where statute silent, equity applies
- Equity supplements statute

**Examples:**
- Trustee Acts codify some trustee powers and duties
- Australian Consumer Law codifies and extends unconscionable conduct
- Corporations Act 2001 codifies directors' fiduciary duties

---

### 8.3 Fusion Debate

**Historical Context:**
- Law and equity administered in separate courts until Judicature Acts (1873-1875 England; 1880s-1900s Australia)
- Now administered in same courts

**Fusion Question:**
- Are law and equity now fused into single system?
- Australian position: Law and equity administered together but remain conceptually distinct
- Different principles, remedies, and defenses

**Practical Effect:**
- Courts apply both legal and equitable principles in single proceeding
- Equitable defenses can defeat legal claims
- Equitable remedies supplement legal remedies
