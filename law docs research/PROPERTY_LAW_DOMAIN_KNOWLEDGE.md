- Protection from unregistered interests
- Subject to exceptions (fraud, statutory exceptions)
```

**Exceptions to Indefeasibility:**
1. **In personam claims** - Personal equities binding registered proprietor
2. **Fraud** - Actual fraud by registered proprietor (not "mere equities")
3. **Statutory exceptions** - Overriding statutes (planning, environment)

## 3. TORRENS SYSTEM PRINCIPLES

### 3.1 Core Concepts

#### **Title by Registration (Not by Transfer)**

```
The Torrens system operates on fundamental principle:
- Title passes on REGISTRATION, not on execution of transfer
- Folio of register is paramount evidence of title
- Certificate of Title is mirror of register
- Registration is constitutive, not declaratory

Contrast with General Law (Old System):
- Deeds based title
- Chain of title investigation required
- No guaranteed title
- Equitable interests bind successors
```

#### **Three Fundamental Principles:**

**1. The Mirror Principle**
```
The register is a complete and accurate mirror of title
- All interests should appear on register
- Purchaser need only examine register
- Off-register interests generally void

Exceptions:
- Short leases (≤3 years)
- Certain statutory interests
- Overriding interests (planning, environment)
- In personam equities
```

**2. The Curtain Principle**
```
Register is a curtain drawn over past transactions
- No investigation of historical title required
- Trust interests kept off register
- Purchaser not concerned with equitable interests

Effect:
- Simplified conveyancing
- Reduced legal costs
- Faster settlements
```

**3. The Insurance Principle**
```
Compensation available for loss due to:
- Register error or omission
- Fraud resulting in registration
- Registrar's mistake

Torrens Assurance Fund:
- Statutory compensation scheme
- Available where indefeasibility defeats prior right
- Subject to limitations and exceptions
```

---

### 3.2 Indefeasibility Types

#### **Immediate Indefeasibility**

```
Australian Rule (Frazer v Walker; Breskvar v Wall):
- Registered proprietor's title indefeasible immediately upon registration
- Even if registration procured by fraud of third party
- Postponement only where fraud by registered proprietor personally

Applies in: NSW, Vic, Qld, SA, WA, Tas, ACT, NT

Effect:
- Strong protection for bona fide purchasers
- Fraudster's victim must claim compensation from Assurance Fund
- Registration validates defective instrument (subject to fraud exception)
```

#### **Deferred Indefeasibility**

```
New Zealand / Minority Australian View:
- Indefeasibility deferred until bona fide purchaser for value
- First registered proprietor may be defeated by prior fraud

Not Current Australian Law
(rejected in Breskvar v Wall)
```

---

### 3.3 Priority Rules

#### **Priority of Registered Interests**

```
Rule: First in time of REGISTRATION prevails

Examples:
1. Mortgage A registered 1/1/2024 at 10am
   Mortgage B registered 1/1/2024 at 11am
   Priority: Mortgage A (first registered)

2. Caveat lodged 1/1/2024
   Mortgage registered 2/1/2024
   Priority: Depends on caveat validity and mortgage knowledge

3. Transfer registered 1/1/2024
   Prior unregistered contract 1/12/2023
   Priority: Registered transfer (registration confers title)
```

#### **Caveats and Priority**

```
Caveat Effect:
- Prevents registration of dealings
- Does not confer indefeasibility
- Protects equitable interest only
- Lapses if not sustained by court order

Priority Rules:
1. Caveat vs later caveat: First in time (absent better equity)
2. Caveat vs mortgage: First to lodge/register
3. Caveat vs transfer: Depends on notice and fraud
4. Lapsed caveat: No priority retained

Common Law Rule: Mortgagee entitled to possession immediately

Modern Practice:
- Covenant in mortgage: Mortgagor entitled to possession until default
- Mortgagee exercises right only after default
- Court order usually sought
- Notice requirements vary by jurisdiction

Defences:
- No default
- Debt paid
- Hardship (court may postpone)
- Breach of Consumer Credit Code
```

#### **Power of Sale**

```
Requirements:
1. Default in payment or breach of covenant
2. Notice of default given (typically 30 days)
3. Default not remedied within notice period
4. Compliance with statutory requirements

Statutory Requirements (example NSW s58 Real Property Act):
- One month's notice
- Notice specifies default and payment required
- Service on mortgagor
- Mortgagee must obtain market value
- Sale by public auction or private treaty

Duties of Mortgagee:
- Exercise power in good faith
- Take reasonable steps to obtain market value
- Not sell at improvident price
- Account to mortgagor for surplus

Priority of Proceeds:
1. Costs of sale
2. First mortgagee debt
3. Second mortgagee debt (if any)
4. Subsequent mortgagees
5. Surplus to mortgagor
```

#### **Foreclosure**

```
Nature: Court order vesting title in mortgagee (rare remedy)

Process:
1. Mortgagee applies to court
2. Court orders account of debt
3. Mortgagor given time to pay (order nisi)
4. If not paid, foreclosure absolute
5. Mortgagor's equity of redemption extinguished

Rarely Used Because:
- Mortgagee cannot claim shortfall after foreclosure
- Sale more advantageous
- Court discretion to order sale instead
```

#### **Appointment of Receiver**

```
Power: Appoint receiver to collect rents and profits

Requirements:
- Mortgage instrument confers power
- Default occurred
- Notice given (if required)

Receiver Functions:
- Collect rents from property
- Manage property
- Apply income to mortgage debt
- Act as agent of mortgagor (usually)

Common in:
- Commercial property mortgages
- Investment property mortgages
- Where possession inappropriate
```

```

#### **Exceptions and Qualifications**

```
1. Fraud Exception:
   Prior interest may prevail if later party committed fraud

2. Notice Exception:
   Later registered mortgagee with notice of prior equity may lose priority

3. In Personam Exception:

## 9. KEY LEGAL CONCEPTS AND KEYWORDS

### 9.1 Core Property Concepts

#### **Fixtures vs Chattels**

```
Distinction: Is item part of the land (fixture) or personal property (chattel)?

Tests:
1. Degree of Annexation:
   - How firmly attached to land?
   - Can it be removed without damage?
   - More firmly attached = more likely fixture

2. Purpose of Annexation:
   - Why was it attached?
   - To improve land permanently = fixture
   - For better enjoyment of chattel = chattel

Examples:
Fixtures:
- Built-in wardrobes
- Hot water system
- Carpet (tacked down)
- Trees and plants
- Buildings and structures
- Lights (wired in)

Chattels:
- Furniture
- Removable appliances
- Curtains and blinds (usually)
- Free-standing appliances
- Artwork

Case Law:
- *Holland v Hodgson* (1872) LR 7 CP 328 - Degree and purpose tests
- *Reid v Smith* (1905) 3 CLR 656 - Tenant's fixtures
- *Australian Provincial Assurance v Coroneo* (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 700

Importance:
- Fixtures pass with land on sale (unless excluded)
- Chattels belong to owner (vendor retains unless included)
- Mortgage security includes fixtures
- Tenant's fixtures may be removed (trade fixtures exception)
```

#### **Adverse Possession**

```
Definition: Acquiring title through long, exclusive possession without permission

Requirements:
1. Factual possession (physical control and use)
2. Intention to possess (animus possidendi)
3. Possession adverse to true owner (without permission)
4. Open and notorious (not secret)
5. Continuous for statutory period
6. Peaceful (not by force)

Statutory Periods:
- 12 years (most jurisdictions under Limitation Acts)
- 15 years (some jurisdictions for Crown land)

Applicability to Torrens Land:
- NSW: Abolished for Torrens land (2010)
- Victoria: Abolished for Torrens land (2018)
- Queensland: Abolished for Torrens land (2013)
- WA: Limited application
- SA: Still possible against Torrens land (under review)
- Other jurisdictions: Varied, generally restricted

Effect:
- True owner's title extinguished after limitation period
- Adverse possessor may apply to be registered as proprietor
- Court application usually required
- Difficult to establish against Torrens title (indefeasibility)

Case Law:
- *Mulcahy v Curramore* [1974] 2 NSWLR 464 - Requirements
- *Buckinghamshire CC v Moran* [1990] Ch 623 - Intention to possess
```

#### **Equitable Interests in Land**

```
Types:
1. Beneficial interest under trust
2. Purchaser's interest under contract for sale
3. Equity of redemption (mortgagor's interest)
4. Interest under option to purchase
5. Interest under right of first refusal
6. Unregistered mortgage
7. Constructive/resulting trust interest

Protection Methods:
- Caveat lodgment (prevents dealings)
- Registration (converts to legal interest)
- Notice to registered proprietor
- Court injunction

Priority Rules:
- First in time prevails (between equitable interests)
- Defeated by later legal interest without notice
- Bona fide purchaser for value without notice takes free
```

---

### 9.2 Lease and Tenancy Concepts

#### **Lease vs License**

```
Lease:
- Proprietary interest in land
- Exclusive possession
- Certainty of term
- Rent (usually, but not essential)
- Assignable (unless restricted)
- Binding on successors
- Must be registered (if >3 years for Torrens land)

License:
- Personal permission to use land
- No exclusive possession
- Revocable (unless coupled with interest)
- Not assignable
- Not binding on successors
- Does not require registration

Tests (Street v Mountford):
1. Exclusive possession: Key indicator of lease
2. Substance over form: Court looks at true nature, not labels
3. Business reality: What was really intended?

Examples:
Lease:
- Retail shop tenancy
- Residential rental
- Industrial warehouse
- Office space

License:
- Hotel room
- Cinema seat
- Storage locker (sometimes)
- Caravan park site (sometimes)
- Service occupancy (e.g., caretaker)
```

#### **Essential Terms of Lease**

```
Certainty Requirements:
1. Parties (lessor and lessee)
2. Property (must be certain and identifiable)
3. Term (must be certain or ascertainable)
   - Fixed term: Specific period
   - Periodic: Week to week, month to month
   - Perpetual renewable: May be void for uncertainty
4. Rent (common but not essential)
5. Commencement date

Implied Covenants (Landlord):
- Quiet enjoyment
- Non-derogation from grant
- Fitness for purpose (limited, mostly statutory)

Implied Covenants (Tenant):
- Pay rent
- Reasonable use
- Waste (not commit waste)
- Repair (varies - generally fair wear and tear excepted)

Express Covenants (Common):
- Permitted use
- Maintenance and repair obligations
- Insurance obligations
- Assignment and subletting restrictions
- Outgoings
- Rent review
- Option to renew
```

#### **Rent Review Mechanisms**

```
1. Fixed Increase:
   - Percentage stated in lease
   - Simple and certain
   - Example: 3% per annum

2. CPI (Consumer Price Index):
   - Linked to inflation measure
   - Most common for commercial leases
   - Formula: CPI increase × base rent
   - Example: If CPI increases 2.5%, rent increases 2.5%

3. Market Review:
   - Rent adjusted to market rate
   - Independent valuation required (usually)
   - Upward only (unless otherwise specified)
   - Dispute resolution clause essential
   - More common in longer leases

4. Turnover Rent:
   - Percentage of tenant's turnover/sales
   - Common in retail leases
   - Base rent plus percentage
   - Landlord entitled to inspect books
   - Example: $50,000 + 7% of gross sales over $1,000,000

5. Ratchet Clause:
   - Rent can only increase, never decrease
   - Common in upward only market reviews
   - May be unfair in declining markets
```

---

### 9.3 Strata Title Concepts

#### **Common Property vs Lot Property**

```
Common Property:
- Owned by all lot owners as tenants in common
- Proportionate to unit entitlement
- Cannot be exclusively used without by-law
- Managed by owners corporation
- Includes:
  * Land not part of lots
  * Structural elements (walls, roof, foundations)
  * Services infrastructure
  * Common areas (foyers, corridors, gardens)

Lot Property:
- Owned individually
- Exclusive possession
- Can be mortgaged, sold, leased independently
- Owner responsible for internal maintenance (usually)
- Defined by deposited strata plan

Common Property Rights By-law:
- Grants exclusive use of common property to specific lot
- Must be registered
- Examples: Parking space, storage cage, courtyard, balcony
- Compensation/fee may apply
```

#### **Airspace and Boundary Issues**

```
Lot Boundaries:
- Vertical: From floor to ceiling (usually)
- Horizontal: Walls (median line or inner face depending on jurisdiction)
- Services: May be common property even if within lot

Balconies:
- May be lot property or common property (depends on plan)
- If common property, exclusive use by-law usually granted

Windows and Doors:
- Structure often common property
- Opening/glass may be lot property
- Maintenance responsibility depends on by-law and statute

Painting:
- External painting: Usually common property (owners corporation)
- Internal painting: Lot owner
- Balcony: Depends on whether balcony is lot or common property

## 11. CASE LAW - KEY PRECEDENTS

### 11.1 Torrens Title and Indefeasibility

**1. *Frazer v Walker* [1967] 1 AC 569 (Privy Council)**
```
Issue: Immediate vs deferred indefeasibility
Held: Immediate indefeasibility applies - registered proprietor's title
      indefeasible immediately upon registration, even if registration
