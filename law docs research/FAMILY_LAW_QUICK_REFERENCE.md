## Legal Test Cheat Sheet

### s60CC BEST INTERESTS TEST

**Mandatory Structure:**
1. Consider PRIMARY considerations first (s60CC(2))
2. Consider ADDITIONAL considerations (s60CC(3))
3. Give most weight to PRIMARY

**PRIMARY CONSIDERATIONS (Must consider both):**
- **(a) Meaningful Relationship:** Benefit of meaningful relationship with both parents
- **(b) Protection from Harm:** Need to protect from abuse, neglect, family violence

**If conflict → Protection from Harm WINS**

**KEY ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:**
- (a) Views of child
- (c) Willingness to facilitate relationship with other parent
- (d) Likely effect of changes
- (f) Capacity to provide for child's needs
- (h) Family violence (if applicable)

**Detection Keywords:**
```
best interests, child welfare, meaningful relationship, safety,
harm, risk, views of child, capacity, family violence
```

### s79 PROPERTY SETTLEMENT (Four-Step Approach)

**STEP 1: Identify & Value Pool**
- What property exists?
- What is net value (assets - liabilities)?

**STEP 2: Assess Contributions (s79(4))**
- (a) Financial contributions
- (b) Non-financial contributions
- (c) Homemaker/parent contributions

Result: Percentage split (e.g., 60/40)

**STEP 3: Assess Future Needs (s75(2))**
- Age and health
- Income and earning capacity
- Care of children under 18
- Duration of marriage/relationship
- Standard of living

Result: Adjustment (typically 0-20%)

**STEP 4: Just & Equitable?**
- Is the final percentage fair?
- Any supervening circumstances?

**Key Case:** *Hickey v Hickey* [2003] FamCA 395

**Detection Keywords:**
```
property settlement, contributions, financial, non-financial,
homemaker, parent, future needs, just and equitable, asset pool
```
