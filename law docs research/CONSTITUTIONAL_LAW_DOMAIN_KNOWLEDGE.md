## Usage Notes

### Classification Guidance
- Constitutional law issues often overlap with administrative law
- S75(v) jurisdiction creates constitutional/administrative law intersection
- Federal jurisdiction questions are constitutional matters
- Implied freedoms cases require constitutional classification
- High Court constitutional matters always classified as constitutional law
- State constitutional issues classified as constitutional law

### Common Misclassifications
- Not all High Court cases are constitutional law (many are statutory interpretation)
- Administrative law judicial review distinct from constitutional judicial review (unless s75(v))
- Federal jurisdiction issues are constitutional, but routine federal court matters may not be
- Human rights cases without constitutional dimension classified separately
- Treaty cases without external affairs power issue may not be constitutional

### Relationship to Other Domains
- **Administrative Law:** Overlaps in judicial review, separation of powers
- **Criminal Law:** S80 trial by jury, criminal legislation validity
- **Property Law:** S51(xxxi) just terms, native title
- **Employment Law:** Industrial relations powers, Work Choices issues
- **Tax Law:** S51(ii) taxation power, s90 excise
- **Immigration Law:** Aliens power, offshore detention
- **Human Rights Law:** Implied freedoms, s116, Kable principle
