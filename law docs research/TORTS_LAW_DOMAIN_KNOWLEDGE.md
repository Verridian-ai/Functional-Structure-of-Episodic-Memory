## 3. KEY LEGAL CONCEPTS & PRINCIPLES

### 3.1 Duty of Care (Negligence)

**Common Law Framework:**

Established in *Donoghue v Stevenson* [1932] AC 562:
> "You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour."

**Modern Australian Test:**

Post *Sullivan v Moody* (2001) and *Crimmins v Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee* (1999):

1. **Foreseeability** of harm
2. **Relationship** of proximity
3. **No contrary considerations** (policy reasons against duty)

**Statutory Codification:**

**NSW - Civil Liability Act 2002 s 5B:**
```
A person is not negligent in failing to take precautions against a risk of harm unless:
(a) the risk was foreseeable (that is, it is a risk of which the person knew or ought to have known)
(b) the risk was not insignificant, and
(c) in the circumstances, a reasonable person in the person's position would have taken those precautions.
```

**NSW - s 5C (calculation of risk):**
Factors to consider:
- Probability of harm occurring
- Likely seriousness of harm
- Burden of taking precautions
- Social utility of the activity

**Queensland - Civil Liability Act 2003 s 9:**
```
Principles concerning resources, responsibilities etc of public authorities
A public authority does not owe a duty of care in relation to a policy decision, but may owe a duty of care in relation to an operational decision.
```

### 3.2 Standard of Care

**The Reasonable Person Test:**

*Blyth v Birmingham Waterworks Co* (1856):
> "Negligence is the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do."

**Professional Standard:**

*Rogers v Whitaker* (1992) 175 CLR 479:
> A medical practitioner has a duty to warn a patient of a material risk inherent in proposed treatment. A risk is material if:
> - A reasonable person in the patient's position would likely attach significance to it; OR
> - The practitioner knows or should know the particular patient would attach significance to it.

**Statutory Modification (NSW):**

Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) **s 5O:**
```
A professional does not breach duty if it is established that the professional acted in a manner widely accepted by peer professional opinion as competent professional practice (Bolam standard with Bolitho qualification).
```

### 3.3 Breach of Duty

**Test:** Did the defendant's conduct fall below the required standard of care?

**Factors:**
- Magnitude of risk
- Probability of harm
- Cost/practicability of precautions
- Social utility

**Statutory Provisions:**

**NSW - Civil Liability Act 2002 s 5B(2):**
> In determining whether a reasonable person would have taken precautions, the court considers:
> (a) probability harm would occur if care not taken
> (b) likely seriousness of harm
> (c) burden of taking precautions to avoid risk
> (d) social utility of the activity

### 3.4 Causation

**Two-Part Test:**

**1. Factual Causation ("But For" Test):**

Would the harm have occurred "but for" the defendant's negligence?

**Test:** *March v E & MH Stramare Pty Ltd* (1991) 171 CLR 506
- Common sense assessment
- "But for" test is guide, not rigid rule

**Statutory Modification (NSW):**

Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) **s 5D:**
```
(1) A determination that negligence caused particular harm comprises:
    (a) that the negligence was a necessary condition of the occurrence of the harm (factual causation), and
    (b) that it is appropriate for the scope of the negligent person's liability to extend to the harm (scope of liability).
```

**2. Legal Causation (Scope of Liability/Remoteness):**

Was the harm within the scope of the risk created by the breach?

**Test:** *Wagon Mound (No 1)* [1961] AC 388
- Harm must be reasonably foreseeable type

**NSW - s 5D(4):**
> In determining scope of liability, court considers (amongst other relevant things) whether the harm was within the scope of the risk giving rise to the breach.

**Medical Causation:**

**Material Contribution Test:**
Where there are multiple potential causes, plaintiff must show defendant's negligence materially contributed to the harm.

*Bonnington Castings Ltd v Wardlaw* [1956] AC 613
*Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd* [2003] 1 AC 32 (modified for asbestos cases)

### 3.5 Remoteness of Damage

**Reasonable Foreseeability Test:**

*Wagon Mound (No 1)* [1961] AC 388:
> Defendant liable only for reasonably foreseeable type of damage.

**Extent of Damage:**

*Hughes v Lord Advocate* [1963] AC 837:
> If type of damage is foreseeable, liable even if extent or precise manner is not.

**"Thin Skull Rule":**

*Smith v Leech Brain & Co Ltd* [1962] 2 QB 405:
> Take victim as you find them - liable for full extent of harm even if unforeseeable due to plaintiff's susceptibility.
