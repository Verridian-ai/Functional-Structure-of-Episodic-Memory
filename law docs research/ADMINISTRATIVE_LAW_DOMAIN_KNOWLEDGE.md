2. **Bias Rule (nemo iudex in causa sua)**: Decision-maker must be impartial

**Key Aspects:**

**Origin:** *Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation* [1948] 1 KB 223

**Australian Application:**
- High threshold for intervention
- Distinct from jurisdictional error (though overlap exists)
- Must be "unreasonableness in the legal sense" or "legal unreasonableness"

**Related Concepts:**
- Illogicality
- Irrationality
- Arbitrary decision-making

### Ultra Vires
Acting beyond legal power or authority.

**Types:**
1. **Substantive ultra vires**: Acting outside the scope of granted powers
2. **Procedural ultra vires**: Failing to follow required procedures

**Application:**

### Standing (Locus Standi)
Who has the right to bring judicial review proceedings?

**Tests:**
- **ADJR Act**: "Person aggrieved" (s 5(1)) - liberally interpreted
- **Constitutional writs**: More restrictive, requires "special interest"

### vs. Constitutional Law (KM)

- **Overlap**: Section 75(v) constitutional writs, separation of powers

- Practice: General civil procedure, court rules, evidence
- **Distinguisher**: ADJR Act procedures, tribunal-specific procedures

### vs. Taxation (KP)
- Admin law: Review of tax decisions through AAT or courts
- Taxation: Substantive tax law (income tax, GST, etc.)
- **Overlap**: Taxation objections and appeals

### vs. Immigration (Substantive)
- Admin law: Procedural review of migration decisions
- Immigration (substantive): Visa criteria, Migration Regulations
- **Overlap**: High overlap; classify based on primary focus

### vs. Employment & Industrial (KL)
- Admin law: Review of Fair Work decisions, public service employment
- Employment: Workplace relations, unfair dismissal merits
- **Distinguisher**: Focus on review vs. substantive employment rights

### vs. Government Liability (KN)
