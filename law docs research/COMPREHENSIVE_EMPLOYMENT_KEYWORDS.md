- Search organization names for tribunal/commission decisions
- Look for procedural terms to identify case stage

### For Machine Learning Models
- Weight high-frequency terms (commission, suspension, RSI)
- Create synonym groups (e.g., FWC = Fair Work Commission)
- Use co-occurrence patterns (e.g., "BOOT" + "enterprise agreement")
- Consider context windows around statutory references

### For Document Tagging
- Multi-label classification recommended (many cases span categories)
- Priority indicators: legislation names, section numbers, organization names
- Technical terms (BOOT, NES, PCBU) = high confidence
- Check for remedies mentioned (reinstatement, compensation) for unfair dismissal
