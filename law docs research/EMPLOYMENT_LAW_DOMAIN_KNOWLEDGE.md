## 7. Key Precedents & Case Law Principles

### Unfair Dismissal
- **Small business exemption** requires employer to have fewer than 15 employees at dismissal time
- **Valid reason** must be sound, defensible, and well-founded
- **Procedural fairness** requires opportunity to respond before decision
- **Genuine redundancy** requires position elimination, consultation, and redeployment consideration
- **Summary dismissal** justified only for serious misconduct making continued employment untenable

### General Protections
- **Reverse onus** requires employer to prove prohibited reasons not part of reason for action
- **Substantial and operative factor** test for establishing causation
- **Multiple reasons** can include both lawful and unlawful reasons
- **Temporal proximity** between protected activity and adverse action can suggest causation
- **Circumstantial evidence** can establish prohibited reason

### Workplace Rights
- **Workplace right** includes enforceable right or benefit under workplace law or instrument
- **Ability to initiate or participate** in process under workplace law is protected
- **Complaint or inquiry** about employment conditions is protected workplace right
- **Reasonable conduct** in exercising workplace right remains protected

### Industrial Relations
- **Good faith bargaining** requires genuine attempt to reach agreement and timely responses
- **Protected action** requires proper notice, ballot approval, and bargaining period
- **Better off overall test** compares agreement to relevant modern award for each employee
- **Nominal expiry date** does not terminate agreement; it continues until replaced or terminated

### Discrimination & Harassment
- **Protected attribute** discrimination requires less favorable treatment because of attribute
- **Comparator analysis** compares treatment to person without protected attribute
- **Indirect discrimination** requires unreasonable requirement disadvantaging group
- **Sexual harassment** requires unwelcome conduct of sexual nature causing reasonable offense
- **Workplace bullying** requires repeated unreasonable behavior creating health/safety risk

## 8. Practice Tips for Classification

### Document Analysis
- **Look for termination language:** "dismissed," "terminated," "let go," "position eliminated"
- **Identify workplace rights mentions:** complaints about pay, safety, conditions
- **Note temporal relationships:** adverse action shortly after protected activity
- **Check for awards/agreements:** references to modern awards or enterprise agreements
- **Identify protected attributes:** age, sex, race, disability, pregnancy, family status
- **Look for injury descriptions:** work-related injuries, psychological harm, disease
- **Note safety concerns:** unsafe work practices, inadequate training, hazardous conditions
- **Check employment status:** casual, permanent, fixed-term, contractor status disputes

### Jurisdictional Indicators
- **Federal system:** references to Fair Work Act, modern awards, FWC
- **State systems:** WA private sector, state public servants, specific state legislation
- **Small business considerations:** employee count, Small Business Fair Dismissal Code
- **High income threshold:** salary above threshold excludes unfair dismissal
- **Minimum employment period:** 6 months (12 for small business) for unfair dismissal
- **Workers compensation:** state-based schemes, work-related injury claims
- **WHS jurisdiction:** notifiable incidents, compliance notices, prosecutions

### Multiple Classification Scenarios
Many employment matters involve multiple overlapping issues:
- **Unfair dismissal + general protections:** termination may be both unfair and discriminatory
- **Workers compensation + unfair dismissal:** injury followed by termination
- **WHS + workers compensation:** unsafe workplace causing compensable injury
- **Discrimination + harassment:** overlapping protected attribute claims
- **Industrial relations + general protections:** union activity leading to adverse action
- **Enterprise agreement + award:** interaction and coverage disputes

### Common Misconceptions
- **Not all terminations are unfair dismissals:** valid reasons and proper process can justify dismissal
- **Independent contractors:** may still have protections under sham contracting provisions
- **At-will employment myth:** Australia does not have at-will employment
- **Casual employees:** have unfair dismissal rights if regular and systematic employment
- **Small business code:** provides defense but does not eliminate unfair dismissal rights
- **Workers compensation bars dismissal:** workers compensation does not prevent termination but may create general protections claim
