## 3. PRECEDENT RULES

### 3.1 Doctrine of Precedent (Stare Decisis)

**Definition:** The rule that a legal principle established by a superior court should be followed in similar cases by that court and other courts

**Latin:** *Stare decisis et non quieta movere* ("to stand by decisions and not disturb settled matters")

**Purpose:**
- Promotes consistency in judicial decision-making
- Ensures like cases are treated alike
- Provides predictability in the law

**Historical Context:** The heyday of strict precedent in Australia was 1865-1966. Modern approach is more flexible while maintaining core principles.

---

### 3.2 Binding Precedent

**Definition:** A precedent that **must** be followed if relevant and circumstances are sufficiently similar

**Rules:**

1. **Vertical Binding (Hierarchical)**
   - Lower courts **must** follow decisions of higher courts in same hierarchy
   - Example: NSW District Court must follow NSW Supreme Court
   - Example: All Australian courts must follow High Court of Australia

2. **Horizontal Binding (Same Level)**
   - Courts are generally **not bound** by courts at same level
   - Exception: Appellate courts often follow their own precedents for consistency

3. **High Court Special Status**
   - High Court binds **all** Australian courts (federal, state, territory)
   - High Court is **not bound** by its own precedents but follows them unless exceptional circumstances

**Test for Binding Precedent:**
1. Was the precedent made by a superior court in the same hierarchy?
2. Are the material facts sufficiently similar?
3. Is the legal principle part of the *ratio decidendi* (not *obiter dicta*)?

---

### 3.3 Persuasive Precedent

**Definition:** A precedent that should be seriously considered but is **not required** to be followed

**Types:**

1. **Inter-State Precedents**
   - NSW Supreme Court decisions are **persuasive** (not binding) on Victorian Supreme Court
   - Same level courts in different jurisdictions

2. **Federal-State Cross-Hierarchy**
   - Federal Court decisions are **persuasive** on state courts
   - State Supreme Courts are **persuasive** on Federal Court
   - Exception: Federal Court binding when applying Commonwealth law

3. **Lower Court Decisions**
   - District Court decisions are persuasive on Supreme Court
   - May be followed if well-reasoned

4. **Foreign Jurisdictions**
   - UK Supreme Court (formerly House of Lords) - highly persuasive
   - Other Commonwealth courts (Canada, New Zealand) - persuasive
   - US Supreme Court - persuasive in constitutional matters

**Factors Affecting Persuasive Weight:**
- Reputation of judge
- Quality of reasoning
- Similarity of legal systems
- Number of courts following the precedent
- Recency of decision

---

### 3.4 When Courts Can Depart from Precedent

#### A. Overruling

**Definition:** A higher court declares a precedent wrong and no longer good law

**Who Can Overrule:**
- High Court can overrule any Australian court decision (including its own)
- State Supreme Courts can overrule lower state courts
- Federal Court Full Court can overrule Federal Court single judge decisions

**High Court Overruling Test (from *Trident* case):**

The High Court will overrule its own precedent only in exceptional circumstances, considering:

1. **Importance of the precedent** - How fundamental is it to the legal system?
2. **Extent of reliance** - Have other courts followed it? Has it been acted upon?
3. **Reasons for the precedent** - Were the original reasons sound?
4. **Changed circumstances** - Has society, technology, or law changed?
5. **Impact on justice** - Would overruling improve administration of justice?

**Scholarly Debate:**
- **Stephen Perry (Conservative View):** "Strong Burkean conception" - overrule only with strong reason
- **B.V. Harris (Liberal View):** Courts should be free to overrule if they assign different weight to reasons; "doing justice in the particular appeal" trumps stare decisis

**Constitutional vs. Common Law Precedents:**
- Constitutional precedents harder to overrule (requires referendum to change Constitution)
- Common law precedents more flexible (Parliament can legislate to override)

---

#### B. Distinguishing

**Definition:** A court finds the current case materially different from the precedent, so precedent doesn't apply

**Method:**
1. Identify material facts of precedent case
2. Identify material facts of current case
3. Show factual difference affects legal outcome
4. Conclude precedent not applicable

**Example:**
- Precedent: Contract dispute involving written agreement
- Current case: Contract dispute involving oral agreement
- Distinction: Statute of Frauds requires writing for enforceability
- Result: Precedent doesn't apply

**Strategic Use:**
- Lawyers use distinguishing to avoid unfavorable precedents
- Judges use it to limit overbroad precedents

---

#### C. Reversing

**Definition:** An appellate court overturns the decision of a lower court in the **same case**

**Not the Same as Overruling:**
- Reversing: Same parties, same case, on appeal
- Overruling: Different case, declaring precedent wrong

---

### 3.5 Inter-Jurisdictional Precedent Value

| Scenario | Binding or Persuasive? | Example |
|----------|------------------------|---------|
| HCA → Any Australian court | **Binding** | HCA precedent binds NSW Supreme Court |
| NSW Supreme Court → NSW District Court | **Binding** | Vertical hierarchy |
| NSW Supreme Court → VIC Supreme Court | **Persuasive** | Different state hierarchies |
| Federal Court → NSW District Court | **Persuasive** | Different hierarchies |
| Federal Court (applying Commonwealth law) → State courts (applying same law) | **Highly Persuasive** | Near-binding in practice |
| UK Supreme Court → Australian courts | **Persuasive** | Historical ties, similar systems |
| District Court → Supreme Court | **Persuasive** | Lower court to higher |

---

### 3.6 Ratio Decidendi vs. Obiter Dicta

#### Ratio Decidendi

**Definition:** The legal principle necessary for the decision; the binding part

**Characteristics:**
- Essential to the outcome
- Forms the precedent
- Binding on lower courts

**Identification Method:**
1. What was the material fact?
2. What was the legal issue?
3. What principle did the court apply to reach its decision?

---

#### Obiter Dicta

**Definition:** "Things said by the way"; remarks not essential to the decision

**Characteristics:**
- Not binding
- May be persuasive (especially from High Court)
- Includes hypothetical scenarios, alternative reasoning, general commentary

**Example:**
- Court decides Case A based on Principle X
- Court says "If the facts were Y, we would apply Principle Z"
- Principle Z is obiter (not necessary for Case A)

---

## 4. MEDIUM NEUTRAL CITATIONS

## 9. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR AGENTS

### 9.1 Citator Agent Instructions

**Function:** Verify citation validity, identify binding precedent status

**Tasks:**

1. **Parse Citation:**
   - Extract year, court abbreviation, judgment number
   - Identify if medium neutral or law report citation

2. **Identify Court:**
   - Map abbreviation to full court name
   - Determine court level and jurisdiction

3. **Determine Binding Status:**
   - Check if precedent court is higher in hierarchy
   - Check if same jurisdiction
   - Apply binding/persuasive rules

4. **Validate Citation Format:**
   - Verify year format `[YEAR]` for medium neutral
   - Verify abbreviation is valid
   - Check judgment number is reasonable

**Example Logic:**
```
if court_abbrev == "HCA":
    binding_on = ["all Australian courts"]
elif court_abbrev in ["NSWSC", "NSWCA", "NSWCCA"]:
    binding_on = ["NSWDC", "NSWLC"]
    persuasive_on = ["other state supreme courts", "federal courts"]
```

---

### 9.2 Ratio Miner Agent Instructions

**Function:** Extract *ratio decidendi* (binding reasoning) from judgments

**Tasks:**

1. **Identify Material Facts:**
   - What facts were essential to the outcome?
   - Extract parties, subject matter, legal issue

2. **Extract Legal Principle:**
   - What rule of law did the court apply?
   - Distinguish from obiter dicta (non-binding comments)

3. **Determine Precedent Scope:**
   - How broad or narrow is the principle?
   - What factual scenarios does it cover?

4. **Check for Distinguishing:**
   - Has the principle been distinguished in later cases?
   - What factual differences mattered?

5. **Track Overruling:**
   - Has this precedent been overruled?
   - By which court and when?

**Ratio Identification Heuristics:**
- Phrases: "We hold that...", "The principle is...", "It follows that..."
- Location: Usually in conclusion or "Reasons for Decision" section
- Necessity: Would outcome change if this reasoning were different?

**Obiter Identification Heuristics:**
- Phrases: "If the facts were different...", "In our view (not necessary for this decision)...", "We note in passing..."
- Hypothetical scenarios
- Alternative reasoning not relied upon
