## Constitutional Foundation

### Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900

The Constitution establishes the framework for the Australian federal system, dividing legislative power between the Commonwealth Parliament and State Parliaments.

#### Key Constitutional Provisions

**Section 51 - Legislative Powers of the Parliament (Concurrent Powers)**

Section 51 enumerates 39 specific heads of power granted to the Commonwealth Parliament. These are primarily concurrent powers, meaning both Commonwealth and State parliaments may legislate on these matters, subject to Section 109 inconsistency rules.

The 39 powers include:

1. **(i)** Trade and commerce with other countries, and among the States
2. **(ii)** Taxation (but so as not to discriminate between States or parts of States)
3. **(iii)** Bounties on the production or export of goods
4. **(iv)** Borrowing money on the public credit of the Commonwealth
5. **(v)** Postal, telegraphic, telephonic, and other like services
6. **(vi)** The naval and military defence of the Commonwealth
7. **(vii)** Lighthouses, lightships, beacons and buoys
8. **(viii)** Astronomical and meteorological observations
9. **(ix)** Quarantine
10. **(x)** Fisheries in Australian waters beyond territorial limits
11. **(xi)** Census and statistics
12. **(xii)** Currency, coinage, and legal tender
13. **(xiii)** Banking (other than State banking); the incorporation of banks, and the issue of paper money
14. **(xiv)** Insurance (other than State insurance); also State insurance extending beyond the limits of the State concerned
15. **(xv)** Weights and measures
16. **(xvi)** Bills of exchange and promissory notes
17. **(xvii)** Bankruptcy and insolvency
18. **(xviii)** Copyrights, patents of inventions and designs, and trade marks
19. **(xix)** Naturalization and aliens
20. **(xx)** Foreign corporations, and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth
21. **(xxi)** Marriage
22. **(xxii)** Divorce and matrimonial causes; and in relation thereto, parental rights, and the custody and guardianship of infants
23. **(xxiii)** Invalid and old-age pensions
24. **(xxiiiA)** The provision of maternity allowances, widows' pensions, child endowment, unemployment, pharmaceutical, sickness and hospital benefits, medical and dental services (but not so as to authorize any form of civil conscription), benefits to students and family allowances (inserted by referendum 1946)
25. **(xxiv)** The service and execution throughout the Commonwealth of the civil and criminal process and the judgments of the courts of the States
26. **(xxv)** The recognition throughout the Commonwealth of the laws, the public Acts and records, and the judicial proceedings of the States
27. **(xxvi)** The people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws (as amended by 1967 referendum)
28. **(xxvii)** Immigration and emigration
29. **(xxviii)** The influx of criminals
30. **(xxix)** External affairs
31. **(xxx)** The relations of the Commonwealth with the islands of the Pacific
32. **(xxxi)** The acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws
33. **(xxxii)** The control of railways with respect to transport for the naval and military purposes of the Commonwealth
34. **(xxxiii)** The acquisition, with the consent of a State, of any railways of the State on terms arranged between the Commonwealth and the State
35. **(xxxiv)** Railway construction and extension in any State with the consent of that State
36. **(xxxv)** Conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State
37. **(xxxvi)** Matters in respect of which this Constitution makes provision until the Parliament otherwise provides
38. **(xxxvii)** Matters referred to the Parliament of the Commonwealth by the Parliament or Parliaments of any State or States, but so that the law shall extend only to States by whose Parliaments the matter is referred, or which afterwards adopt the law
39. **(xxxix)** Matters incidental to the execution of any power vested by this Constitution in the Parliament or in either House thereof, or in the Government of the Commonwealth, or in the Federal Judicature, or in any department or officer of the Commonwealth

**Section 52 - Exclusive Powers of the Parliament**

The Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to:

- **(i)** The seat of government of the Commonwealth, and all places acquired by the Commonwealth for public purposes
- **(ii)** Matters relating to any department of the public service the control of which is by this Constitution transferred to the Executive Government of the Commonwealth
- **(iii)** Other matters declared by this Constitution to be within the exclusive power of the Parliament

**Section 90 - Exclusive Power Over Customs, Excise, and Bounties**

"On the imposition of uniform duties of customs the power of the Parliament to impose duties of customs and of excise, and to grant bounties on the production or export of goods, shall become exclusive."

This section gives the Commonwealth exclusive power over:
- Customs duties
- Excise duties
- Bounties on production or export

States are prohibited from imposing customs or excise taxes.

**Section 109 - Inconsistency of Laws**

"When a law of a State is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be invalid."

This is the supremacy clause of the Australian Constitution. It operates in two ways:

1. **Direct Inconsistency**: Where it is impossible to obey both the Commonwealth and State law simultaneously, or where one law confers a right that the other takes away
2. **Indirect Inconsistency (Cover the Field)**: Where the Commonwealth Parliament intends to "cover the field" of a particular area, State laws in that field become invalid even if not directly contradictory

**Section 122 - Government of Territories**

"The Parliament may make laws for the government of any territory surrendered by any State to and accepted by the Commonwealth, or of any territory placed by the Queen under the authority of and accepted by the Commonwealth, or otherwise acquired by the Commonwealth, and may allow the representation of such territory in either House of the Parliament to the extent and on the terms which it thinks fit."

Key features:
- Plenary (complete) power over territories
- Not limited by other Constitutional provisions (including Section 51)
- Commonwealth Parliament can confer self-government on territories
- Territory legislatures derive power from Commonwealth legislation, not from the Constitution itself
